### How I added files to my GitHub Repository:
```
I went to my GitBash,
THEN, navigate to my cloned repository for this project.
THEN, I type git status
THEN, since there is a lot that I need to update on my repository
THEN, I type git add -A
THEN, git commit -m "I changed css and html file, please read README.md"

DONE!
